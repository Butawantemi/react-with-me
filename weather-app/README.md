# 🌦️ React Weather App

This is a clean **Weather App** built with **React JS** And **Vite** which fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeather API**. Users can search for any city around the world and get details such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

> 💡 Project built as part of my React learning journey - Day 24.
